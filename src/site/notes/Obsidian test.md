While reading and testing through a lot many blogs i got stuck at obsidian and decided to use the same.  

Though obsidian looks interesting it has some interesting feature which is only available with this app.

For example with obsidian i am able to use community supported tools.

These community supported tools as modules basically allow one to extend obsidian.

Obsidian does have markdown support. The markdown version can allow interesting nite taking capablities, apart from this. Obsidian also allows to take control over the font selection and other aspect of the app.

### installing obsidian on windows
While I downloaded obsidian on windows but couldn't encourage myself to use it.
#### Why 
While I download any windows applications it goes through my rigorous routine upload check at virus total. If i get th3 slightest of hint that the app contains malicious software. J just don't install the same.

After installing obsidian i configured it to use with netlify app. Basically using digital garden community maintained obsidian extension.

My site is running at [om' digital garden]( https://omdg.netlify.app) 

What can we do with obsidian
1. Note taking
2. Mind mapping
3. Git publishing
4. Prepare daily pallner
5. Take digital notes
