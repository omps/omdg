# welcome to om's digital garden.
Hi my name is Om Prakash Singh and this is my digital garden.

### a digital garden?
Shortly they are a collection of evolving ideas, not necessarily published in any organised way, its mostly your personal wiki and ideation center.
The concept is not new but it's getting the fire again as lot of content creators are moving back to storing information about the knowledge of things, which could be about anything.

I have published my [first post ](Obsidian-test)on digital garden on obsidian at netlify app.
